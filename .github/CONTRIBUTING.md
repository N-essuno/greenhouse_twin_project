# Contributing to the greenhouse twin project

Thanks for considering contributing to this project, this repo serves mainly as a meta repo so go to each subproject's repo in case you want to add something to the code. In case you found yourself using some new sensors or actuators and want to add to the physical setup guides here's how you should do it:

1. Fork this repo and start working on your contribution
2. Open a pull request (PR) outlining your contribution
3. A maintainer will review your PR and eventually modify it a bit to make it better align with the style we used throughout the documentation
4. If the review passes your PR will be merged
